This is TubeOracle, a simplified 2D mesh generator and Solver Software for engineering.

TubeOracle based on finite element analysis, so it is used for finite elements computing
only. In addition, it uses GMSH to realize mesh generation and matrix algorithm to solve
any target aims in mechanics. Our GUI is programed by QT5 and Plotting is realized by its
tool QcustomPlot 2 (all declared in license). Product of current release version 1.0 is open
source, thanks for your support.
